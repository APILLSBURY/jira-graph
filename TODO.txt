* Filter or highlighting for critical path and unblocked work
* overall/in-progress/remaining breakdown by epic
* milestone view overlaying several epics

* look into D3 force directed graphs for organizing
* look into gephi

* quick package script that bundles the binary with 'static' and 'templates'

clean up items:
* set the epic key & summary in the page as a 'data' element, use that instead of the parsed URL
* JSX-aware JS formatting; maybe add a linter?
* JQL parameter sanitization
